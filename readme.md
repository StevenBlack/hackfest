# Hackfest 2023

These are the notes for my [Hackfest 2023](https://hackfest.ca/) presentation.

The topic is presented in French. The title of the presentaton is "***Bitcoin: Cool et pas √† peu pr√®s***" which is colloquial 
French for "***Bitcoin: Cool and not nearly***".  Which means, in essence, *Bitcoin is pretty cool*. 

The aim of the session is to explain Bitcoin while highlighting its cooler technical facets. In 45 minutes.

### Introduction

Here I extemporaneously explain who I am, why I'm here, and what I'm going to talk about. You had to be there.

### Epistemology of Bitcoin (some high level conclusions)

Why does it feel like explaining Bitcoin is so hard? It feels like
understanding Bitcoin has a high activation energy, with an elevated  "hump" that dissuades many people from understanding it.

If we list Bitcoin's salient subjects, and cross-reference among them for
prerequisite relationships, we get a table that looks like this.

**All matrices can be represented as a graph network**. Here's the graph network of these prerequisite relationships. What a mess! Where to start 
to explain Bitcoin in a coherent way?

Let's use a **layered graph layout** to visualize the subject prerequisite relationships. This is a little better, but it's still a mess.

We can **analyze the network graph for cliques**. This is interesting because
it shows how some concepts are more tightly related.  This seems to be is a promising starting point for segmenting the subject matter.

What if we score subjects for their prerequisite value, their complexity (the number of prerequisites), and subtract the complexity score 
from the prerequisite value?  

In other words, the strategy is to start with the subjects that have the highest prerequisite value, and the lowest complexity.

This gives us a pretty nice roadmap! 

|   prerequisite (P)  | complexity (C)  | P - C  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |

### BTC, satoshis, and unit bias

Bitcoin values are expressed in satoshis. 1 BTC is 100,000,000 satoshis. This is why we see at most 8 decimals in Bitcoin values.

Note that, when we express a value denominated in BTC, we typically get a decimal value. Fun fact: this is the ONLY place in the Bitcoin universe 
where we see a real number, or a decimal of any sort. Bitcoin world is all about integer values only.

You may have heard something to the effect that ***"Bitcoin is at the leading edge of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science"***.  This is a little bit of an overstatement.  

For example, here are some math symbols you won't see in Bitcoin world:

```
‚âà   ùùÖ   ‚ÑØ   i   ‚àö   ‚àÇx/‚àÇt   ‚à´   Œ£   ‚àè   Œº   œÉ   n!   Œµ   ‚àû   √∑
```
In fact, you won't see any vectors or matrices either. There are no angles, there is no trig. There are no imaginary numbers.  There are no negative numbers 
either. There are no fractions.  There are no decimals and no irrational numbers.  Bitcoin's math is actually accessible to anyone who has completed 
grade 8 mathematics.

As for cryptography, there is nothing encrypled in Bitcoin, so there's nothing to decrypt either. The cryptography primitives used by the Bitcoin network is 
all about hashing and digital signatures, which widely accessible subjects, and certainly not at all "at the leading edge of cryptography."
### Hashing, blocks, proof of work, and mining

### Bitcoin's heartbeat: Block time, mining difficulty, and mining difficulty adjustments

### Halving and issuance
